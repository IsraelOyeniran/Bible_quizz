            plans is to promote spiritual growth and maturity among participants.

            God and develop a better understanding of their faith.

            <strong>Knowledge and Understanding:</strong> Bible study plans aim to help participants 
            gain a deeper knowledge and understanding of the Bible's teachings, 
            stories, and principles. This includes learning about the historical 
            and cultural context of the Bible.
            <br><br><br>
                
            <strong>Application:</strong> Bible study plans often encourage participants to 
            apply the teachings of the Bible to their daily lives.

            applied to personal challenges, decisions, and ethical dilemmas.
