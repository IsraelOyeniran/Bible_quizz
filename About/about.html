            God and develop a better understanding of their faith.

            <strong>Knowledge and Understanding:</strong> Bible reading plans aim to help participants 
            gain a deeper knowledge and understanding of the Bible's teachings, 
            stories, and principles. This includes learning about the historical 
            and cultural context of the Bible.

            <strong>Application:</strong> Bible reading plans often encourage participants to 
            apply the teachings of the Bible to their daily lives. 
            This may involve discussing how biblical principles can be 
            applied to personal challenges, decisions, and ethical dilemmas.
